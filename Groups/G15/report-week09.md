### Delegation vs. Inheritance

Inheritance focuses on creating static and incremental definitions, which often lead to rigid and less adaptable designs. It is particularly useful for establishing abstractions and organizing hierarchies.

On the other hand, delegation provides more flexibility and modularity by allowing dynamic behavior at runtime.

When comparing these approaches, several criteria can be considered. The first is the ease of adding new formatting algorithms and integrating them into the system. The second is whether it is possible to package and deploy a new algorithm independently from the others. Finally, one must evaluate if the system can dynamically switch between different algorithms during runtime.
