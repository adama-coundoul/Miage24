### Delegation vs. Inheritance

Inheritance
- is about incremental static definition
- can lead to static design
- helps defining abstractions

 Delegation
 - brings runtime flexibility and modularity

Some criteria to compare solutions :
- Addition
 What is the cost to define a new formatting algorithm?
 - Packaging
 Can I deploy a new formatting algorithm separately from others?
 - Dynamic switch
 Can I dynamically switch to another formatting algorithm?
